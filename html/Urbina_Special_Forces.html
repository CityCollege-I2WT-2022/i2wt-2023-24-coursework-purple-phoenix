<!--Cosas a arreglar
    -  darle otra forma a lo de los rangos pq queda demasiado cutre
    -  Decorar tabla de materiales pq es sosita
    -  Quitar el lu de lo de titulacion o no titulacion en oficales
    -  Quitar los headers en las listas de los años que tiene que hacer y ponerlo inline
    -  Hacer que para ver mas informacion tenga que hacer click en la parte de oficiales suboficiales y tropa tienes que retocar practicamente todo ahí
    -  Ponerle un background de la bandera de España a los headers
    -  Yo pondria que la barra de navegacion sea block para que no pueda tener nada detras, y ademas si la idea es que no se vea cuando vas navegando por ahi es mejor que sea blok
